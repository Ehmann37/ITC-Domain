                    <H3>Reasons why i choose computer science</h3>
                    <p class="analysis">
                        I chose Computer Science (CS) as my course of study due to my curiosity and interest in technology, particularly in how it can be used to innovate and make a significant impact in today's Information and Digital Age. i believes CS aligns well with my skills and interests, such as problem-solving and coding, and I see it as a field that will further develop these abilities, helping me achieve my career goals. My interest in coding began in Grade 10 when i took up Computer Programming (ComProg) using the C language. This experience sparked my passion for coding, leading me to explore coding algorithms and learning other programming languages like C++ and Python. Additionally, i am drawn to CS because of its high demand in the job market and the attractive salaries it offers.
