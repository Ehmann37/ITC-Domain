            <section id="numbersystem" class="paragraph">
                <p><strong>Number System</strong> is a method of representing numbers on the number line with the help of a
                    set of Symbols and rules. These symbols range from 0-9 and are termed as digits. Let’s learn
                    about the number system in detail, including its types, and conversion.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Number system</strong> in Maths is a writing system for expressing numbers. It is a mathematical
                    notation for representing numbers of a given set, consistently using digits or other symbols.
                    It allows us to perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
                    division.
                    </p>

                <p>Our number system is a western adaptation of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system developed
                    somewhere between the first and fourth centuries AD. However, numbers have been
                    recorded with tally marks throughout history. The Ishango Bone[1] from Africa is about 25,000
                    years old. It’s the lower leg bone from a baboon, and contains tally marks. We know the
                    marks were used for counting because they appear in distinct groups</p>
                <p>The number system is a method to notify or represent the numbers of a given set or identity
                    using symbols of relative significance. There are different types of number systems in which
                    a single number can be represented in multiple ways.
                </p>
                <p>The number system helps us identify the extent to which we need to limit an entity. These
                    give us a general insight into the mathematical operations regarding the given numbers. This
                    helps in the calculation of numbers using mathematical operations. Visit more about how
                    the number system is used in real life</p>
                <p>In the number system, numbers can be seen from different types of bases, and one needs
                    to know how to convert them as needed. Although there are various technical methods for
                    that, it is important to know how to do it alone with someone’s words in the basic foundation
                    of learning information technology. I hope to talk about how to easily convert numbers
                    between these different bases and some other important points.
                    </p>
                <p><strong>Numerals</strong> are the symbols used to represent small numbers, and numeral systems are
                    collections of these symbols together with systems of rules for representing larger numbers</p>

                <h3>1. Ancient Counting (Prehistoric Times)</h3>
                <p>Early humans used basic counting methods, often using tally marks on bones or stones
                    to represent quantities. This was the beginning of a base-1 or unary system.</p>

                <h3>2. Babylonian System (c. 2000 BCE)</h3>
                <p>- The Babylonians developed one of the earliest sophisticated number systems, a base-60
                    (sexagesimal) system. They used symbols for 1 and 10, and their system influenced modern
                    concepts of time (60 seconds, 60 minutes).</p>

                <h3>3. Egyptian Numerals (c. 3000 BCE)</h3>
                <p>The Egyptians used a base-10 system (decimal), based on the number of fingers. They had
                    symbols for 1, 10, 100, and so on, but did not have a concept of zero.</p>

                <p>The Maya developed a vigesimal (base-20) system. Remarkably, they also had a symbol
                    for zero, one of the earliest known uses of zero in history.</p>

                    values. Roman numerals were non-positional and lacked a symbol for zero, which limited
                    their arithmetic operations.

                    today, was developed in India and later spread to the
                    Islamic world and Europe. It introduced the decimal (base10) system and the concept of zero as a number. This
                    positional system allowed for easier calculation and laid the
                    foundation for modern arithmetic.</p>

                <p>In the 17th century, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz introduced the binary (base-2) system,
                    which uses only two symbols (0 and 1). This system became essential to computer science
                    and digital technology.</p>
                    <p>Other number systems like octal (base-8) and hexadecimal (base-16) were later
                        developed to simplify binary representation, especially in computing.
                        </p>
                        <p>Today, these systems—binary, decimal, octal, and hexadecimal—are integral to
                            mathematics, computing, and various scientific fields.</p>

                <p>Based on the base value and the number of allowed digits, number systems are of many
                    types.</p>

                <h3>1. Decimal Number System</h3>
                <p>Decimal is a numbering system that uses a base-10 representation for numeric
                    values. The system is used extensively in everyday life to carry out routine tasks such as
                    buying groceries, trading stocks, tracking football scores, or scrolling through cable
                    channels</p>
                <p>The position of each digit in a weighted number system is assigned a weight based on
                    the <strong>base</strong> or <strong>radix</strong> of the system. The radix of decimal numbers is ten, because only ten
                    symbols (0 through 9) are used to represent any number. </p>
                <p>The decimal system is also referred to as the <strong>Hindu-Arabic system</strong>.

                <h3>2. Binary Number System</h3>
                <p>The term binary also refers to any digital encoding/decoding system in which there
                    are exactly two possible states. In digital data memory, storage, processing and
                    communications, the 0 and 1 values are sometimes called low and high, respectively. In
                    transistors, 1 refers to a flow of electricity, while 0 represents no flow of electricity.
                    </p>
                <p>A binary number system is one of the four types of number systems. In computer
                    applications, binary numbers are represented by only two symbols or digits, i.e., 0 (zero) and
                    1 (one). The binary numbers here are expressed in the base-2 numeral system. For example,
                    (101)2 is a binary number. Each digit in this system is said to be a bit. Learn more about
                    binary.</p>
                <p>For digital systems, the binary number system is used. Binary has a radix of two and
                    uses the digits 0 and 1 to represent quantities. The column weights of binary numbers are
                    powers of two that increase from right to left beginning with 20 =1:</p>

                <h3>3. Octal Number System</h3>
                <p>The Octal Number System has a base of eight and uses the numbers from 0 to 7. The
                    octal numbers, in the number system, are usually represented by binary numbers when they
                    are grouped in pairs of three. For example, an octal number 128 is expressed as 0010102 in
                    the binary system, where 1 is equivalent to 001 and 2 is equivalent to 010.</p>
                <p>Octal is also a weighted number system. The column weights are powers of 8, which
                    increase from right to left</p>
                <p>The main advantage of using the octal number system is that it uses fewer digits than
                    the decimal and hexadecimal number system. So, it has fewer calculations and thereby less
                    calculation errors.</p>

                <h3>4. Hexadecimal Number System</h3>
                <p>The hexadecimal number system is a type of number system that has a base value equal
                    to 16. It is also pronounced sometimes as ‘hex’. Hexadecimal numbers are represented by
                    only 16 symbols. These symbols or values are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E and F.
                    Each digit represents a decimal value.
                    </p>
                <p>Hexadecimal is a weighted number system. The column weights are powers of 16, which

                <p>Computers can represent numbers using binary code in the form of digital 1s and 0s
                    inside the central processing unit (CPU) and RAM. These digital numbers are electrical

                                length of an object is a multiple of the given graduation. For example,
                                while measuring the length of a table with a metre scale, the length may
                                not be a whole number, it may lie between two graduations on the

                            <li>1 m = 100 cm</li>

                            based on its weight. As we know,</li>
                        <li>1 kg = 1000 gm</li>

                <h3>Hexadecimal</h3>
                <p>In computing systems, the binary string equivalents of large decimal numbers can
                    become quite long. When 16- or 32-bit numbers are involved, it becomes difficult to read
                    and write them without producing errors. These problems can be overcome by arranging the
                    binary numbers into groups of four bits, i.e., by using the hexadecimal numbering system.

                    <p>As a computer science student, I realized that understanding number systems is very
                        important because they form the foundation of how computers process and store data. Whether
                        dealing with basic arithmetic operations or complex algorithms, number systems are important to
                        programming, memory allocation, data representation, and networking. Computers uses binary
                        system, and us in daily life uses decimal system, but knowledge of various number systems like octal
                        and hexadecimal is crucial for efficient data manipulation and interpretation, especially in low-level
                        programming and digital electronics.
                        </p>
                    <p>A number system is a mathematical method used to represent numbers using a set of digits.
                        Each system is based on a radix, or base, like 2,8,10, or 16, which determines how many unique digits
                        are used before resetting and carrying over to the next positional value. Number systems act as
                        frameworks through which calculations can be made and quantities may be expressed; they are the
                        backbone of most fields including computer science.
                        </p>
                    <p>There are several types of number systems, each with a different base. The most familiar,
                        which we use every day, is the decimal system (base-10), which uses digits 0-9 and is prevalent in
                        everyday life for counting and arithmetic. Binary (base-2), which only uses 0 and 1, is crucial in
                        computing, where data is stored and processed in binary form. Octal (base-8), using digits 0-7,
                        serves as a shorthand for binary in older computer systems and in UNIX systems, while hexadecimal
                        (base-16), with digits 0-9 and A-F, is widely used in modern computing for memory addressing,
                        representation of color codes, error messages, etc.
                        
                        </p>
                    <p>Each number system has its own significance and use. The decimal system is practical for
                        human activities, while binary is essential for digital electronics and computing. Octal and
                        hexadecimal simplify binary data representation, making it easier for humans to interpret large
                        binary numbers. Hexadecimal is especially useful in programming and web development, where it
                        simplifies the management of memory addresses, representation of color codes, error messages,
                        etc.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, knowing the number systems especially it’s types and their uses is vital for
                        anyone like me that is studying in computer science. They provide the framework for data
                        representation, making programming more efficient and enabling effective communication with the
                        machine. Understanding these systems prepare students to tackle more advanced concepts in
                        computing and digital systems.</p>
