                    <h3>1. Legacy Form Factors: AT and LPX</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>AT Motherboard:</strong> The AT motherboard (Advanced Technology) marked the early
                        era of computer design, boasting a massive build of 12x13 inches. It featured 4-6
                        PCI slots, basic BIOS, and early Intel chipsets. However, its reliance on external
                        expansion cards for I/O and its cumbersome size limited its adaptability to
                        modern computing needs, leading to its decline as newer, more efficient
                        standards emerged.</li>
                    <li><strong>LPX Motherboard:</strong> : LPX (Low Profile Extension) motherboards introduced
                        innovations like riser cards for horizontal expansion, which allowed for slimmer
                        cases. However, their reliance on outdated chipsets and limited I/O capabilities
                        made them unsuitable for high-performance or feature-rich systems, eventually
                        rendering them obsolete.
                        </li>
                </ul>
                </section>
    
                <section class="paragraph">
                    <h3>2. Standard Form Factors: ATX and Variants</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>ATX:</strong> The ATX (Advanced Technology Extended) design is the
                        cornerstone of modern motherboard architecture, balancing functionality and
                        versatility. Measuring 12x9.6 inches, it offers compatibility with a wide range of
                        Intel and AMD chipsets, 1 CPU slot, 2-4 memory slots, 5-7 PCI slots, and up to 8
                        SATA ports. Its modern BIOS and support for PCIe lanes make it ideal for
                        gaming, workstations, and general-purpose systems.
                        </li>
                    <li><strong>Extended-ATX (E-ATX):</strong> A larger, more powerful variant of ATX, the E-ATX
                        motherboard (12x13 inches) caters to high-performance systems. It supports
                        multiple CPUs, 6-8 memory slots, and multi-GPU setups, making it the preferred
                        choice for professional workstations and servers requiring enhanced computing
                        power and memory capacity</li>
                </ul>
    
                </section>
                <section class="paragraph">
                    <h3>3. Compact Form Factors: Micro-ATX, Mini-ITX, and Mini-ATX</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Micro-ATX:</strong> : Slightly smaller than ATX, Micro-ATX boards (9x9.6 inches) are a
                        cost-effective solution for budget-conscious users. With 2-3 memory slots, 3-4
                        PCI slots, and up to 6 SATA ports, it balances compactness and functionality,
                        suiting office systems, budget gaming rigs, and entry-level workstations.
                        </li>
                    <li><strong>Mini-ITX:</strong> Measuring just 6.7x6.7 inches, Mini-ITX boards prioritize compactness
                        for space-constrained environments. Despite their size, they feature 1 CPU slot,
                        2 memory slots, and built-in Wi-Fi or LAN options, making them ideal for home
                        theater PCs (HTPCs) and portable builds.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mini-ATX:</strong> Slightly larger than Mini-ITX (11.2x8.2 inches), Mini-ATX
                        motherboards focus on compact and power-efficient systems. With support for 1
                        CPU, 2 memory slots, and 2-3 PCI slots, they are often found in lightweight,
                        embedded systems.</li>

                    <h3>4. High-Performance Designs: BTX and Pico BTX</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>BTX Motherboard:</strong> The Balanced Technology Extended (BTX) motherboard
                        introduced innovations in airflow and thermal management, addressing heat
                        dissipation in high-performance systems. With a size of 12.8x10.5 inches, it
                        features advanced thermal design and enhanced I/O capabilities but struggled to
                        compete with ATX's market dominance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pico BTX:</strong> A smaller version of BTX, Pico BTX emphasizes power efficiency and
                        compactness. With support for 1-2 memory slots and minimal SATA and PCI
                        options, it targets ultra-compact systems, such as embedded or industrial
                        applications.</li>

                    <h3>5. Standard-ATX Motherboards</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Standard-ATX motherboard retains its popularity due to its balanced feature
                        set. Offering support for 2-4 memory slots, 5-7 PCI slots, and compatibility with
                        both Intel and AMD chipsets, it remains a versatile option for general-purpose
                        systems, gaming, and productivity.</li>
