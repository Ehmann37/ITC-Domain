                <p>The HP Mini 110 is a compact system with limited processing power and memory,
                    designed for basic applications such as small-scale data management or
                    education. Its energy consumption, averaging around 18–30 W, makes it an ecofriendly choice for users with minimal computing needs. However, it lacks the
                    capability to perform resource-intensive tasks.
                    </p>

                <p><strong>4. Server (HPE ProLiant DL380 Gen10): </strong></p>
                <p>Servers like the HPE ProLiant DL380 Gen10 are engineered to handle multiple
                    simultaneous requests, making them ideal for hosting websites, managing
                    databases, and cloud applications. With power consumption ranging from 500 W to
                    1,200 W, these systems feature multi-core CPUs and expandable memory,
                    ensuring scalability and high availability.
                    
                    </p>
                <p><strong>5. Workstation (Dell Precision 5820 Tower): </strong></p>
                <p>Workstations are tailored for professionals requiring high performance for tasks
                    such as 3D rendering, CAD, and video editing. The Dell Precision 5820 Tower,
                    consuming 500–950 W, provides powerful CPUs and GPUs, large memory, and
                    advanced cooling solutions. Its performance bridges the gap between personal
                    computers and high-end servers.
                    
                    </p>

                <p><strong>6. Microcomputer (Raspberry Pi 4): </strong></p>
                <p>The Raspberry Pi 4 demonstrates the versatility of microcomputers. With energy
                    consumption as low as 5–7 W, it is ideal for projects requiring low power, such as
                    IoT, education, or lightweight server hosting. Its limited processing speed and
                    memory make it unsuitable for heavy computing, but its affordability and size make
                    it highly accessible.
